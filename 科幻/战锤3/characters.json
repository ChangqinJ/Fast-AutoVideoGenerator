Strong jawline visible beneath the helmet, with weathered skin showing signs of combat exposure. Athletic and powerful frame suggesting years of military training and field experience.",
        "dynamic_features": "Wearing heavily damaged blue-and-gold armor with visible dents, scratches, and scorch marks across the chest plate and pauldrons. The armor shows a worn metallic sheen with chipped paint revealing darker metal underneath. Gold trim along the edges is tarnished and partially scraped away. A tactical helmet with a dark visor covers most of the head. Combat boots caked with dust and grime. The entire ensemble bears the marks of recent intense battle."
